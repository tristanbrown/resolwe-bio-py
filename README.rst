Resolwe SDK for Python supports interaction with Resolwe_ server
and its extension `Resolwe Bioinformatics`_. You can use it to upload
and inspect biomedical data sets, contribute annotations, run
analysis, and write pipelines.

Docs & Help
===========

Read the detailed description in documentation_.

.. _documentation: http://resdk.readthedocs.io/

Install
=======

Install from PyPI::

  pip install resdk

If you use macOS, be aware that the version of `Python shipped with the
system doesn't support TLSv1.2`_, which is required for connecting to
any ``genialis.com`` server (and probably others). To solve the issue,
install the latest version of Python 2.7 or Python 3 `via official
installer from Python.org`_ or `with Homebrew`_.

.. _`Python shipped with the system doesn't support TLSv1.2`:

If you would like to contribute to the SDK codebase, follow the
`installation steps for developers`_.

Quick Start
===========

In this showcase we will download the aligned reads and their
index (BAM and BAI) from the server:

.. code-block:: python

   import resdk

   # Create a Resolwe object to interact with the server
   res = resdk.Resolwe(url='https://app.genialis.com')

   # Enable verbose logging to standard output
   resdk.start_logging()

   # Get sample meta-data from the server
   sample = res.sample.get('mouse-example-chr19')

   # Download files associated with the sample
   sample.download()

Both files (BAM and BAI) have downloaded to the working directory.
Check them out. To learn more about the Resolwe SDK continue with
`Getting started`_.
